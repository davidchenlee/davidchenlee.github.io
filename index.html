<p>I am currently designing and building a high throughput two-photon microscope for imaging large volumes of fixed tissue –as large as 1 cm^3– in-situ and with sub-micron resolution. This novel technology will be used to understand how cells form tissue at large scales in 3D.</p>

<p>As part of this project, I have established a new Mesoimaging Laboratory at the MPI-CBG.</p>

I work in close collaboration with the <a href="http://zerial.mpi-cbg.de/">Zerial Lab</a> to study cell organization in mouse liver.
