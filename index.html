<hr>
<p>I am currently designing and building a two-photon microscope
	capable of imaging large volumes of fixed tissue –as large as 1 cm^3– with
	sub-micron resolution and in-situ. This novel technology will be used to understand
	how cells form tissue at large scales in 3D.</p>

<p>As part of this project, I have established a new advanced microscopy laboratory at the MPI-CBG.</p>
