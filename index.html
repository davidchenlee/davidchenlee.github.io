<p style="text-align:justify">Observing biological systems across multiple spatial scales is essential to understanding how tissues, organs, and organisms emerge from a collection of interacting molecules and cells. In order to look at biological systems across scales, imaging tools must not only be able to resolve the smallest structures of interest but also span extensive lengths at the highest possible resolution. Imaging large samples poses several challenges to data acquisition and analysis. For example, thick and opaque samples require imaging methods capable of penetrating deep inside the tissue; large samples need high-performance imaging modalities and data handling; and accurate cellular and sub-cellular segmentation requires high-resolution images. To overcome these challenges, I have built a ultrafast two-photon microscope capable of imaging large fixed tissues–as big as one cubic centimeter–with sub-micron resolution. I aim to use these novel technology to leverage the understanding of tissue architecture and self-organization.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> As part of this project, I have established a new Mesoimaging Laboratory at the MPI-CBG. Here is a time-lapse <a href="https://twitter.com/bigimaginglab/status/964987879926718464">video</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> As a particular application of the meso-imaging platform, the Myers Lab aims to digitally reconstruct an entire mouse liver. We work in close collaboration with biologists in the <a href="http://zerial.mpi-cbg.de/">Zerial Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.mpi-cbg.de">MPI-CBG</a> and theorists at the <a href="https://www.pks.mpg.de/">MPI-PKS</a> to perform large-scale analytics on the tissue such as statistics on the cell localization, size, polarity, density, and connectivity, to aid the formulation of multi-scale models for systems biology. For more information, check out the seminal work <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/11214">"A versatile pipeline for the multi-scale digital reconstruction and quantitative analysis of 3D tissue architecture"</a>
