<hr>
<p>I am building a high throughput two-photon microscope to image whole fixed tissue as large as 1 cm3, in-situ, and with sub-micron resolution. This novel technology will be used to explore the spatial organization of cells across scales. As part of this project, I have established a new Meso-imaging Laboratory at the MPI-CBG.</p>

<p>
This project is carried out in close collaboration with the <a href="http://zerial.mpi-cbg.de/">Zerial Lab</a>. We aim to digitally reconstruct an entire mouse liver to understand how cells form meso and macroscopic strucures. For more information, check out their seminal work: <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/11214">"A versatile pipeline for the multi-scale digital reconstruction and quantitative analysis of 3D tissue architecture"</a>
